Host genetic factors responsible for the interindividual differences in naturally occurring antibody responses to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) in human beings have not been identified. The aim of the present investigation was to determine whether immunoglobulin gamma heavy-chain marker (GM) and kappa light-chain marker (KM) allotypes, which are genetic markers of IgG heavy chains and Îº-type light chains, respectively, contribute to these differences. A total of 152 Estonian women with breast cancer were characterized for IgG antibodies to HER-2 and allotyped for several GM and KM markers. IgG3 determinant GM 13 was significantly associated with higher HER-2 IgG levels (median IgG titer 800 vs 400, p = 0.007). Other GM allotypes, known to be in linkage disequilibrium with GM 13, were also associated with higher anti-HER-2 antibody levels, albeit not as strongly. These results show that GM allotypes are associated with humoral immunity to HER-2, a finding with potentially significant implications for immunotherapy of breast cancer.
