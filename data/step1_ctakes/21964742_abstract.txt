Hepatopulmonary syndrome is a pulmonary vascular complication of cirrhosis in which intrapulmonary vasodilatation (IPV) results in hypoxemia. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), produced by proliferating cholangiocytes, has been identified as a mediator of IPV in an animal model of HPS, but the pathophysiology of IPV in humans has not been defined.The purpose of this study was to assess whether cirrhosis with IPV, which often leads to HPS, is associated with increased hepatic venous ET-1 blood levels.We performed a prospective cohort pilot study of 40 patients with liver disease undergoing transjugular liver biopsy from November 1, 2008 to September 1, 2009. Patients were categorized according to absence (-) or presence (+) of IPV as determined by bubble-contrasted echocardiography. Hepatic venous blood was assayed for ET-1 by ELISA. The percent volume of cholangiocytes in the liver biopsy specimen was determined by morphometric analysis, as a measure of bile duct proliferation.Nine subjects were excluded, due to absence of cirrhosis (6) and patent foramen ovale (3). Of the remaining 31 subjects, IPV was present in 18 (58%). Median hepatic venous ET-1 was higher with IPV+ than IPV- at levels of 9.1 pg/mL (range 7.5-11.7) versus 2.1 pg/mL (1.3-5.6), respectively (P = 0.004). ET-1 levels correlated positively with cholangiocyte percent volume (r = 0.72, P < 0.001) but not with measures of liver dysfunction (bilirubin, INR, MELD score, or hepatic venous pressure gradient).In human cirrhosis, increased hepatic venous ET-1 is associated with IPV and increased hepatic cholangiocyte volume.
