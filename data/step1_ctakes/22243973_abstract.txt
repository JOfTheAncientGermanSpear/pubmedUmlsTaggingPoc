Adherence to treatment is a common challenge when working with patients with voice disorders. Improving their self-efficacy through a mastery experience has the potential to improve treatment adherence. An ideal mastery experience gives early and quick evidence that the patient will be successful with the treatment and works for a broad range of patients. This study sought to test whether a brief stimulability trial of forward focused voice could produce sufficient change in acoustic analysis measures to provide visibly improved objective results and, thus, be aÂ potentially useful mastery experience.Prospective, repeated measures, pre- and posttreatment.Twenty-four consecutive patients with varying diagnoses referred for a voice evaluation participated in this study. Acoustic analysis was completed before and after a short stimulability trial of forward focused voice. Acoustic analysis parameters evaluated include fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, noise-to-harmonic ratio, and voice turbulence index. Data pre- and posttreatment were analyzed for change and compared with normative values.Results demonstrated a significant change from pre- to posttrial, as indicated by the objective measure transitioning from being outside to within normal limits, in 75% of patients (P=0.000). When less rigid criterion of a positive change in one or more of the three acoustic measures of interest is used, improvement was noted in 96% of patients.Pairing a trial therapy with acoustic analysis during a voice evaluation is a possible mastery experience. Future research is needed to determine if this mastery experience improves self-efficacy, treatment adherence, and treatment outcomes.
