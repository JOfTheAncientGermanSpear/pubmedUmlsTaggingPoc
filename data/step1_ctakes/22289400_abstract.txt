This article reviews the evidence of the use of community-based participatory research (CBPR) and smoking cessation interventions. An overview of CBPR is provided, along with a description of the search methods and quality scoring. Research questions are explored to determine if CBPR improves the quality of research methods and community involvement in cessation intervention studies and cessation outcomes when using CBPR approaches. Results of the review are provided along with a comprehensive table summarizing all the included studies. Strengths and challenges of the CBPR approach are presented with recommendations for future research.
