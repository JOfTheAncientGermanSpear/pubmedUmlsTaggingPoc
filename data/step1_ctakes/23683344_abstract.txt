This multi-visit, real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging feedback study demonstrates that treatment-seeking smokers can effectively modulate their behavioral and brain responses to smoking cues. They are more effective at decreasing activity in functionally defined regions involved in "craving" (e.g. ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC)) rather than increasing activity in regions involved in "resisting" (e.g. dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)).
