In the past several years, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported regarding the efficacy of treadmill-based walking-specific rehabilitation programs, either individually (TT) or combined with body weight support (BWSTT), over control group therapies poststroke. No clear consensus exists as to whether treadmill-based interventions are superior in rehabilitating walking speed (WS) poststroke.To review published RCTs examining TT and BWSTT poststroke and describe the effects on improving and retaining WS.A systematic literature search in computerized databases was conducted to identify RCTs whose methodological quality was assessed with PEDro. Pre- and post-WS, change in WS, functional outcomes, and follow-up speed were extracted and calculated from each study. Additionally, statistical results of each study were examined, and the intragroup and intergroup effect sizes (ESintra and ESinter, respectively) were calculated.All studies (8 TT; 7 BWSTT) met the inclusion criteria, and their methodological quality was generally good, with a mean PEDro score 6.9/10. Of the 15 studies, 8 studies (4 TT; 4 BWSTT) reported intragroup significant increases of WS, whereas only 4 (4 TT) found superiority of treadmill interventions. Nine studies demonstrated large ESintra (4 TT; 5 BWSTT), yet only 3 showed large ESinter (1 TT; 2 BWSTT). Four studies (2 TT and 2 BWSTT) reported retention of gains in WS, regardless of intervention.Treadmill-based interventions poststroke may increase and retain WS, but their universal superiority to other control group therapies has failed to be established.
