Mitochondrial biogenesis may be an adaptive response necessary for meeting the increased metabolic and energy demands during organ recovery after acute injury, and renal mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AKI. We proposed that stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis 24 hours after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced AKI, when renal dysfunction is maximal, would accelerate recovery of mitochondrial and renal function in mice. We recently showed that formoterol, a potent, highly specific, and long-acting Î²2-adrenergic agonist, induces renal mitochondrial biogenesis in naive mice. Animals were subjected to sham or I/R-induced AKI, followed by once-daily intraperitoneal injection with vehicle or formoterol beginning 24 hours after surgery and continuing through 144 hours after surgery. Treatment with formoterol restored renal function, rescued renal tubules from injury, and diminished necrosis after I/R-induced AKI. Concomitantly, formoterol stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis and restored the expression and function of mitochondrial proteins. Taken together, these results provide proof of principle that a novel drug therapy to treat AKI, and potentially other acute organ failures, works by restoring mitochondrial function and accelerating the recovery of renal function after injury has occurred.
