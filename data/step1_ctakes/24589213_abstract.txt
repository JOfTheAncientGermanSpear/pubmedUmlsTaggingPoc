The purpose of this study was to explore the factors associated with hospital utilization among infants and young children with complex chronic conditions (CCC).A descriptive, retrospective study was conducted with 216 medical records of children with CCC.Greater complexity, younger age, living with siblings, use of public insurance or self-pay, use of more than one type of insurance, and presence of conditions affecting certain body systems were associated with increased hospital and emergency department (ED) utilization.Nurses must have a heightened awareness of these at-risk characteristics to prevent avoidable hospital admissions and ED visits.
